## Speech Recognition and Translation

This Python script demonstrates how to use the `speech_recognition` library to recognize speech and translate it using the `googletrans` library.

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `speech_recognition`
- `googletrans`
- `pyttsx3`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install speech_recognition googletrans pyttsx3
```

### Usage

1. Run the script using the command `python mk.py`.
2. Speak a sentence when prompted.
3. The script will recognize your speech and translate it from English to Hindi.
4. The translated text will be spoken out loud using the `pyttsx3` library.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, make sure you have a working microphone connected to your computer and that it is properly configured.

### Note

The script uses the Google Translate API for translation. Make sure you have a stable internet connection for the translation to work properly.
